<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Mechanical Engineer leveraging a strong background in analytical problem-solving and system design to transition into Software Engineering. During my project management experience in Germany, I discovered the power of software by automating workflows using Python and n8n. This experience sparked a passion for building scalable systems, leading me to pursue rigorous computer science training through Harvard University’s CS50.

Current Focus:

Core Computer Science: Mastering C, Memory Management (Pointers), and Data Structures.
Backend Development: Building foundations for Python/Django based applications.
Engineering Approach: Applying engineering discipline to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code.

I am looking for Junior Software Engineer or Backend Developer roles where I can contribute with my technical adaptability and disciplined work ethic.</p>
